=== Q4 ===
Two reasons branches are used in Git:
1. Isolate new features and experiment without breaking the main branch.
2. Enable parallel work and safer reviews or merges.

=== Q5 ===
- git log : shows commit history (who/when/message/hash)
- git status : shows working tree state vs last commit (modified/staged/untracked)

=== Q6 ===
Command Used: 
git log --oneline --name-only --follow -- Vehicle.h
Results: 
03106e9 -> Declared the trivial destructors for all classes -> Fully formatted toString methods for all classes -> Added test cases in the main method for testing the implementations -> Added validation on value for engine sizes in the  Car class
Vehicle.h
f9cd890 -> Partial implementation of PoweredVehicle and Car -> Definition of virtual functions
Vehicle.h
f9c24b0 Refactored Vehicle class to separate definition and declarations Added mileageEstimate abstract method to Vehicle Implemented the Bicycle class
Vehicle.h
4f6c88c Base Vehicle class created
Vehicle.h

=== Q7 ===
Command Used:
git log --oneline --grep="file" -i
Result: 
f4975e5 -> Adding an empty README.md file

=== Q8 ===
OOP quick definitions 
Inheritance — a subclass reuses or extends a superclass. It gets fields/methods and can override behavior.
Polymorphism — a common type or interface that lets different subclasses respond with their own overridden methods at runtime.
Encapsulation — keeps data and methods together and hide internals behind a public interface to reduce coupling and bugs.

=== Q9 ===
The main difference is that in the Integration Manager setup, one person handles merging everyone’s work into the main repo.
In the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, a few trusted lieutenants handle merges for smaller groups, and only the dictator pushes to the main repo. 
It spreads out the work but still keeps control at the top.

=== Q10  ===
Instead of everyone pushing to one place and creating conflicts, lieutenants manage their groups, then the dictator reviews and merges everything cleanly. 
It saves time and avoids chaos.
